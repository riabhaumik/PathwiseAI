# Fixes Implemented for Pathwise AI

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Roadmap Loading Issues
**Problem**: Roadmaps were not loading due to path resolution problems in the backend service.

**Root Cause**: The `RoadmapService` was unable to locate the `careers_stem.json` file due to incorrect path resolution logic.

**Fixes Implemented**:
- Enhanced path resolution in `backend/app/services/roadmap_service.py`
- Added multiple fallback paths for different deployment scenarios
- Improved error handling with fallback data to prevent crashes
- Added comprehensive logging for debugging path issues

**Files Modified**:
- `backend/app/services/roadmap_service.py` - Fixed path resolution and added fallback data
- `backend/app/api/roadmap.py` - Enhanced debug endpoints
- `frontend/src/app/roadmap/[career]/page.tsx` - Improved error handling and fallback data

### 2. Interview Prep Challenge Problems Missing
**Problem**: The interview prep section had no challenge problems visible to users.

**Root Cause**: Frontend was failing to fetch data from backend API endpoints, and there was no fallback data.

**Fixes Implemented**:
- Enhanced API endpoint compatibility in frontend
- Added comprehensive fallback data for challenging problems
- Improved error handling with multiple API endpoint attempts
- Added test endpoints for debugging

**Files Modified**:
- `frontend/src/app/practice/page.tsx` - Enhanced API fetching and fallback data
- `backend/app/api/interview_prep.py` - Added test endpoint and improved error handling

## Testing the Fixes

### Backend Testing

1. **Test Roadmap Service**:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   python test_roadmap.py
   ```

2. **Test Complete Backend**:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   python start_and_test.py
   ```

3. **Manual API Testing**:
   ```bash
   # Test roadmap endpoints
   curl http://localhost:8000/api/roadmap/debug/careers
   curl http://localhost:8000/api/roadmap/preview/Software%20Engineer
   
   # Test interview prep endpoints
   curl http://localhost:8000/api/interview_prep/test
   curl http://localhost:8000/api/challenging-problems
   ```

### Frontend Testing

1. **Test Roadmap Loading**:
   - Navigate to `/roadmap/Software-Engineer`
   - Verify roadmap loads with phases, milestones, and skill domains
   - Check browser console for any errors

2. **Test Interview Prep**:
   - Navigate to `/practice`
   - Verify challenging problems section appears
   - Test category and difficulty filtering
   - Check that problems display with examples, hints, and solutions

## Debug Endpoints Added

### Roadmap Debug Endpoints
- `GET /api/roadmap/debug/careers` - Test careers data loading
- `GET /api/roadmap/debug/test-roadmap` - Test basic roadmap generation

### Interview Prep Debug Endpoints
- `GET /api/interview_prep/test` - Test interview prep data loading

## Fallback Data Implemented

### Roadmap Fallback
- Basic roadmap structure with 3 phases (Foundation, Intermediate, Advanced)
- Default milestones and skill domains
- Prevents crashes when backend data is unavailable

### Interview Prep Fallback
- Sample challenging problems (Two Sum, Valid Parentheses)
- Basic categories and difficulty levels
- Ensures users always see content

## Path Resolution Improvements

The backend now tries multiple paths to locate data files:

1. Relative to service file location
2. Current working directory
3. Project root directory
4. Backend directory
5. Fallback to current directory

This ensures compatibility across different deployment scenarios (local development, Docker, Railway, etc.).

## Error Handling Enhancements

- Comprehensive try-catch blocks around all data loading operations
- Detailed logging for debugging
- Graceful degradation with fallback data
- User-friendly error messages in frontend

## Next Steps

1. **Test the fixes** using the provided test scripts
2. **Verify data files** are in the correct locations
3. **Check API endpoints** are responding correctly
4. **Monitor frontend** for any remaining issues

## Troubleshooting

If issues persist:

1. Check backend logs for path resolution errors
2. Verify `careers_stem.json` exists in `backend/data/`
3. Test individual API endpoints manually
4. Use debug endpoints to identify specific problems
5. Check file permissions and paths

## Files Created/Modified

**New Files**:
- `backend/test_roadmap.py` - Roadmap service testing script
- `backend/start_and_test.py` - Comprehensive backend testing script
- `FIXES_IMPLEMENTED.md` - This documentation

**Modified Files**:
- `backend/app/services/roadmap_service.py` - Fixed path resolution
- `backend/app/api/roadmap.py` - Enhanced debug endpoints
- `backend/app/api/interview_prep.py` - Added test endpoint
- `frontend/src/app/practice/page.tsx` - Enhanced API fetching
- `frontend/src/app/roadmap/[career]/page.tsx` - Improved error handling

All fixes maintain backward compatibility and include comprehensive fallback mechanisms to ensure the application remains functional even when some components fail.
