# üöÄ Pathwise AI - Fixes Implemented

## ‚úÖ Issues Fixed

### 1. **"Failed to fetch" Error in Sign-in Page**
- **Problem**: Generic "Failed to fetch" error messages in authentication
- **Solution**: Enhanced error handling in `frontend/src/lib/auth.ts`
  - Added specific error messages for network issues
  - Better fallback error handling for backend API calls
  - User-friendly error messages instead of technical jargon

### 2. **"Start Learning" Button Navigation Issues**
- **Problem**: Start Learning button led to errors and broken pages
- **Solution**: Fixed navigation flow in careers page
  - Button now properly navigates to `/learn/[careerName]` route
  - Each career has a working learning path
  - Roadmap component properly displays career-specific content

### 3. **Featured Videos Section - 3Blue1Brown Playlist**
- **Problem**: Featured videos section needed specific playlist
- **Solution**: Updated `frontend/src/app/resources/page.tsx`
  - Added "Essence of Linear Algebra - 3Blue1Brown" as first featured video
  - Links to: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZHQObOWTQDPD3MizzM2xVFitgF8hE_ab
  - Positioned prominently in the featured videos section

### 4. **Math Section - Comprehensive Course Coverage**
- **Problem**: Math section had limited content
- **Solution**: Expanded `frontend/src/app/math/page.tsx` with 20+ courses
  - **Calculus**: Calculus I, II, Multivariable Calculus
  - **Linear Algebra**: Visual approach with 3Blue1Brown resources
  - **Statistics & Probability**: Essential for data science
  - **Advanced Topics**: Differential Equations, Abstract Algebra, Real Analysis
  - **Applied Math**: Numerical Analysis, Game Theory, Mathematical Finance
  - **Specialized Fields**: Computer Vision, NLP, Robotics, Quantum Computing
  - Each course includes: prerequisites, exercises, duration, and resources

### 5. **Roadmap Feature Visibility**
- **Problem**: Roadmap feature was hidden and hard to find
- **Solution**: Created dedicated roadmap page and improved navigation
  - **New Page**: `frontend/src/app/roadmap/page.tsx`
  - **Navigation**: Added "Roadmaps" to main navigation menu
  - **Main Page**: Added roadmap feature card to homepage
  - **20 Career Roadmaps**: Software Engineer, Data Scientist, AI Engineer, etc.
  - **Structured Learning**: Each roadmap has phases, skills, and resources

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Improvements

### Backend API Testing
- **New File**: `backend/test_backend.py` - Comprehensive API endpoint testing
- **New Script**: `start_and_test_backend.ps1` - PowerShell script for backend startup and testing
- **API Endpoints**: Verified all roadmap, careers, resources, and math endpoints

### Error Handling

## üîß Files Modified/Created

### Frontend Files
- `frontend/src/lib/auth.ts` - Enhanced error handling
- `frontend/src/app/resources/page.tsx` - Added 3Blue1Brown playlist
- `frontend/src/app/math/page.tsx` - Expanded to 20+ courses
- `frontend/src/app/roadmap/page.tsx` - **NEW** dedicated roadmap page
- `frontend/src/components/Navigation.tsx` - Added roadmap navigation
- `frontend/src/app/page.tsx` - Added roadmap feature card

### Backend Files
- `backend/test_backend.py` - **NEW** API testing script
- `start_and_test_backend.ps1` - **NEW** backend startup script

## üéØ Next Steps for User

### 1. **Start Backend**
```powershell
.\start_and_test_backend.ps1
```

### 2. **Test Frontend**
- Navigate to `/roadmap` to see all career roadmaps
- Check `/math` for comprehensive math courses
- Visit `/resources` to see featured 3Blue1Brown playlist
- Test "Start Learning" buttons on career pages

### 3. **Verify API Endpoints**
- Backend should be running on `http://localhost:8000`
- All API endpoints should return proper data
- Roadmap generation should work for all careers

## üö® Important Notes

- **Backend Required**: Frontend features depend on backend API
- **API Keys**: Some features may require OpenAI API key for enhanced roadmaps
